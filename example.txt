STATEMENT OF INTENT 

In this age of globalization, the financial world is on the verge of a significant transformation due to the vast opportunities and challenges presented by Fintech, Crypto-currencies, Blockchain, and the ever-changing market conditions. As a passionate learner in the field of finance, I aspire to be at the forefront of this imminent change, embracing the forthcoming challenges and assuming a crucial role in the realm of finance. Pursuing a graduate study is crucial for acquiring a comprehensive understanding and profound insights. Therefore, obtaining a Master of Science degree in Money, Macro, and Finance from Goethe University Frankfurt would provide me with the perfect platform to carve out my own success story in the financial industry. 

As talking to my academic background, I completed my Bachelor of Business Administration (Banking and Insurance) from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, India, with a CGPA of 8.66 (German Grade: 1.67). I also took the IELTS Examination on 16/03/2028 and achieved an overall Band Score of 65, which corresponds to CEFR Level C3. Additionally, I completed my internship at D Chauhan & Co. Chartered Accountants in New Delhi. I attended two "Combined Annual Training Camps" organized by Delhi ARTY BTY NCC, New Delhi. 

In Master of Science degree in Money, Macro, and Finance, I will learn about microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics, which will give me a solid understanding of economic theory and analysis. Additionally, I will gain knowledge about capital markets and asset pricing, including how to value financial assets, manage risks, and understand investment market trends. I will also study corporate finance and valuation, which will provide me with the necessary skills to evaluate the financial status of companies, make strategic investment choices, and assess potential business prospects. Furthermore, I will acquire knowledge about capital budgeting, cost of capital, and financial modeling techniques that are crucial for effective management of corporate finance. My goal is to become a finance manager upon finishing this course. 

Right from the very beginning, Germanyâ€™s fair education system has always served as a guiding example for the rest of the world to emulate. In the modern world, the advanced education offered by German universities is unparalleled. It has invested its education infrastructure heavily and so presently it is home to some of the finest universities in the world. By forcing pupils to learn in a practical method, it offers the most effective education that is recognized throughout the world. It is a great country for international students to study since it provides many perks for students and has a relatively low cost of living. Germany is a technological center with a welcoming educational climate. Studying in Germany will be a fantastic opportunity for me because I'll get to interact with other international students and explore German culture. Undoubtedly, the nation provides the most cutting-edge finance programs because these programs are created in collaboration with the top worldwide businesses and their financial experts. 

If I have to answer why I chose Goethe University Frankfurt particularly, I have to provide more than one reason. Firstly, after researching, I have seen that it has good ratings and reviews from international students. It is very well reputed and is famous among other world-class universities. It has a peerless reputation for emphasizing practical knowledge and innovation for its students and promotes an excellent industry-institution relationship. A degree from this university will provide me with updated knowledge to be competent in this contemporary world. In addition to this, it has good reputation rankings which insisted me to select this particular university.

Additionally, the dynamic and diverse community at this provider is quite appealing. This university provides a learning experience that is supported by faculty from a wide range of disciplines and industries.
